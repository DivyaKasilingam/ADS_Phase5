Electricity Price Prediction

This repository contains code for electricity price prediction using machine learning. You can use this code to predict electricity prices based on historical data.

Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
Python libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for data visualization)
TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
XGBoost (for gradient boosting models)
You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow xgboost
Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the code:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DivyaKasilingam/ADS_Phase5
cd electricity-price-prediction
Data Preparation:

You'll need historical electricity price data. Place your data file (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/electricity-price-prediction) in the project's root directory.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

If you'd like to explore the data and visualize it, open the EDA.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to generate insights about the dataset.

Model Training:

Choose a machine learning model or deep learning model for electricity price prediction. You can find different model scripts in the models directory. For example, to train a deep learning model, run:

bash
Copy code
python models/deep_learning_model.py
Model Evaluation:

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance by running:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Prediction:

To make predictions on future electricity prices, use the model you trained. You can also refer to the prediction notebook (Prediction.ipynb) for a step-by-step guide.

Results:

The code will generate various metrics and visualizations to evaluate the model's performance. You can find the results in the results directory.

Configuration
You can configure hyperparameters and settings in the model scripts or notebooks. Ensure to review and modify these settings to suit your specific use case.
